Roy Lewallen's (W7EL) simple feed system.

Models used with an Arrayfeed1 example.

2src90 model is used to know the impedance and reactance at the feedpoints.

TL model uses the feedline lengths calculated with Arrayfeed1 in the transmission
lines feature with a virtual connection where they meet, the source is connected at this point.

TL_M model includes an L match network to match to 50 ohms resistive.
